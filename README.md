### Rice Species Classification

In this project, we classify Rice types Osmancik and Cammeo using RapidMiner Studio.

- Osmancik and Cammeo are rice variety found in Turkey.
- The dataset was retrieved from UCI and Kaggle.
- RapidMiner Studio was used for this project. It consists of pre-defined processes of algorithms, that are used to build out the Data Science and Machine learning architecture and workflow.
- We performed various classification algorithms, such as Random Forest, SVMand KNN with Cross Validation. Deep Learning and Clustering was also performed.
- Confusion Matric, ROC AUC, Accuracy and other metric were used to evaluate the performace of models used.
